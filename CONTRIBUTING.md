# Contribution of Arch.js
Arch.js isn't a very serious project. It really doesn't have much real use, 
but it is a fun tool for programmers to express theirselves in a new way; much like
learning how to program an old C64 in assembly.

I do, however expect any contributers to be responsible and serious.
I expect any contributers to post actual issues, instead of ones made in a JavaScript console, or on an old flip-phone
with a browser. Good examples of issues include a program not working properly, or text not displaying the right character.

I also expect feature requests to be reasonable and sensable.
I do not want to see a feature request for you to put your name in the console when starting up.
Good examples of feature requests include more instructions in arch_js16 and arch_js16 Assembly Language, or examples
of kernels, filesystems, and OSs.

When making pull requests, simply, do not add *nothing*, do not just add your name, but add something you want that
might be useful to others, or implement a feature request. Be responsible and mature.

What I do expect out of all of these and anywhere else this project is mentioned, be nice.
Bullying and harrassment is not tolerated. Do not lecture someone for asking a silly question or one thats already answered,
or code that you do not like and/or is not useful. Come on guys, this is GitHub, not Stack Overflow. Be the mature adults
that you are, and if you aren't an adult, be mature.

Thank you.
